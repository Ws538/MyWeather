# MyWeather

## Description

MyWeather is a platform that displays current weather in any city in the wrold, displaying current time from the chosen location. Below are 5 other weather displays that show min and max temp for the following 12 hrs in 3 hr intervals. Another neat feature is the background, searching for any photos taken from the specific City.

OpenweatherMap API has been used to create this project, the use of their current weather api and their 5 day, 3 hr interval API. This is my first project working with APIs and as challenging as it was, it has also been a rewarding journey. 

Some challenges faced were pulling the correct data wanted, and as this project is still ongoing, im still challenged with getting the correct current time displayed assoicated with different time zones and UNIX time.
